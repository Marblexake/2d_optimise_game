class FrameManager{

a list for topFrame

a list for bottomFrame

maybe i can change the orietation of the bottom sprites and name the ones i want to be the first child all the way to the first child.


with my method numChildren is always the same. aka 6

gotta find another way finding out the distance between the frames.
